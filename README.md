The Digital Traffic Regulation Orders (D-TRO) Beta project is currently underway with enhancements proposed to the data model, being conducted by Harrod Booth Consulting Ltd and PA Consulting, working alongside the DfT. Welcome to our new Public External GitHub repository. 

Following release of the service Alpha (previously the 3.1.1 version of the data model), we are pleased to share the latest release (3.2.1) as part of the D-TRO Beta project for your input and feedback on, with the main updates around the data model proposed being the implementation of records management, live reporting of TTROs and enabling more effective location referencing.

This GitHub will be the repository for supporting documentation and artefacts required by those participating in validation and providing feedback during the D-TRO Beta phase.

As part of the current release of the Data Specification (version 3.2.1), we are providing the following: 

- User Guide detailing the content and structure of the D-TRO data model
- Data Model - QEA and XMI extracts
- JSON schema
- JSON sample D-TRO record
- Validation rules
- Interface Control Documents for Publishers and Consumers (specifying the API interface for data extraction, supply and publication)
  
An updated API as part of the D-TRO Beta Phase is currently under development.
